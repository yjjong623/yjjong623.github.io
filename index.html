								<p>
    Welcome to my site! Here are some (not-so-interesting, possibly interesting) facts about me!
    <br>1. I was born and raised in Southern California. My parents immigrated from Korea, making me a Korean American. 
    <br>2. Currently, I am a rising sophomore at Yale University interested in Computer Science, Economics, and Public Health. 
    For now, I declared Computer Science as my major, but I am looking to pursue a more interdisciplinary education which might 
    mean that I will end up double majoring! Stay tuned to see what I decide to do with my life!
    <br>3. I was a ballerina for 10 years until I injured my hip + was going through a rebellious phase in my life where I stopped wanting to do everything. 
    You would think I am flexible, but I am one of the stiffest person I know. I can barely touch my toes without screaming. I will say though that my back is still 
    pretty flexible. 
    <br>4. I am really passionate about using technology for social good, especially in the field of public health and healthcare. I will be posting some good book recommendations on this website occasionally 
    (aka whenever I have time to read instead of doing my computer science psets). Books like "Winner Takes All" by Anand Giridharadas changed my mind on 
    whether tech companies such as Microsoft are actually doing good for the world with their "philanthropy". I argue no, but that is up to you to decide.
